# 18-Video-SearchingAlgorithms

#### Create a program that:
1. Takes input from a webcam and then stores the pixels locally.
2. Sorts your data using a sort that is ```n*log(n)``` in speed.
3. Using the sorted data, create a program that uses a binary search algorithm to find a pixel of a particular colour. You could look for pixels with red value 150. Then change it on the screen.
4. Using the **unsorted** data, create a program that uses a linear search algorithm to find something on the screen.  You could look for pixels with red value 150. Then change it on the screen.
