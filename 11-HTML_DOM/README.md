# 11-HTML_DOM

###This assignment builds on the [objects assignment](https://github.com/NikhilRO/Grade12_Assignments/tree/master/09-ObjectsAssignment) 

Following the theme of fire created a fireworks animated/dynamic visual, *with the added customization of being able to control the end location of flames*

The added slidebar alters the alpha value of the background, thereby changing the transparency of the background. 

## Instructions:
1. Move around the mouse while clicking it to store the end locations of the flames of the fireworks
2. Press "B" or "b" to blast the fireworks.
3. Press "R" or "r" to reset the program.

**Error notes:**
Always duplicate a vector before sending it to an object otherwise all the objects created will point to the same location in the memory. Check Issue [#3](https://github.com/NikhilRO/Grade12_Assignments/issues/3) for more info
