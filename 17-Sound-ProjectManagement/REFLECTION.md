### Review the management of the project (i.e. compare the plan to the actual performance, outline successes, etc. in a reflection)

I would be lying if I said if I am not disappointed. I am disappointed because my customers (grade 1's :) ) would not witness the true potential of a grade 12 computer science student at John Fraser. 

A big part of the assignment was planning your project and planning it in a way that is suitable to our customers. It should be able to satisfy the needs of a group of grade 1 students. I went through three ideas. I didn't really like any of them because of a few reasons: (these reasons cropped while was working on the idea)

1. **Too simple for them**: I wanted to give them something that had more than one moving piece. 
2. **Too complicated for them**: You don't want too much stimulus. That can be overwhelming.
3. **No useful way to implement the sound received from them**: Our customers would be happier if their sounds did more than just playing in the background.
4. **This was meant to be a short project**: I didn't want to write a thousand lines of code for a 1 week assignment; mainly, because it involves a lot of bugs and troubleshooting. 



​	To clarify, all this stuff is before I started coding anything. Uncertainty as to which one to choose lead to me to delay my decision to start coding; leading to subsequent delays. Contrary to conventional wisdom, I am not lazy; it just didn't feel right :')

​	With time running out of hands, I decided to model my project after doodlejump. It seemed like it did a good job of being simple and interesting simultaneously. The plan was ready. I got to coding. One problem worth mentioning is what do with their sounds. I decided to put blocks at a distance based on their amplitude. I would consider this a success. 

​	The mechanics of the game are simple enough if you can work with arrays and objects. The only real challenge is getting the scrolling right. I think I failed at that (70 percent). Last year, the scrolling was a challenge in culminating too, but I had lots of time to try thousands of combination to see which one worked best. I just couldn't afford to do that. One week. 

​	Going back to the purpose of the project, delivering a product that suits your customer, I think succeeded partially at that. My failure is not getting the project done on time. Also, the bugs like scrolling. To be fair, when it comes to bugs, in real life, there is alpha and then beta testing. We didn't get that opportunity (maybe, future classes?). 

​	To conclude, the reason I am disappointed is that I couldn't deliver that perfect project that I could.
