####For grade 12 project:
I thought I wanted to build a game. Then I reflected, and realized that I should try to do something with all the exciting stuff we learned in Grade 12; working with data. Now, I am thining either Big Data or working with API. They are fairly similar. In Big Data, I have the data with me; in contrast, with APIs, I am asking some piece of code to give me data. I could do Image analysis but I wonder what am I going to analyze. In conclusion, analysis of input data it is. You ask what on, I am not sure.

1. Include a list of tasks: Create a aesthetically pleasing visualization.
2. Deliverables: a piece of code that's hopefully elegant. 
3. Planned schedule: get it done by Jan 22. This way, I have one day for final touches.

Edits: I decided on Big Data (Algae). Reasons:
  * Image analysis: I wanted to do this but wasn't sure what [my teacher] wanted. Maybe, after getting some clarification, I might do this as well. The main issue is I have no clue how image processing (like facial recognition) work. All I know is working with the pixels of the image. I don't know what sort of analysis can you do on individual pixels.
  * API(s): Daniel Shiffman discouraged me (that doesn't happen very often, does it?). I wanted to work with the Twitter API but he mentioned Node.js blah... Some stuff I wasn't motivated to learn; primarily because I wanted to use the knowledge I already had; I forget real easy. Culminating is one way to make sure, one last time, that I know Grade 12 Comp sci. 
  * Working with .csv is surprisingly fun after you know regex. As fate would have it, I realized soon enough p5.js has loadTable; so, I didn't really use regex. I might still build a csvEngine just for fun.


####Some Day:
##### For my Big Data project:
  * Add functionality to have user input any .csv file and display my visualization.
  * Learn about scopes. [Look here](https://github.com/NikhilRO/Grade12_Assignments/blob/248d54c325459fa6dc71486d87e57a75be49954c/Culminating/Bubble.js#L1) and [here](https://github.com/NikhilRO/Grade12_Assignments/blob/248d54c325459fa6dc71486d87e57a75be49954c/Culminating/README.md)
  * More efficient/impressive packing algorithm for bubbles/circles
  * Add Google image API for images of objects at last level.
