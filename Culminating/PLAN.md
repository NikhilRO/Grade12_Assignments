I thought I wanted to build a game. Then I reflected, and realized that I should try to do something with all the exciting stuff we learned in Grade 12; working with data. Now, I am thining either Big Data or working with API. They are fairly similar. In Big Data, I have the data with me; in contrast, with APIs, I am asking some piece of code to give me data. I could do Image analysis but I wonder what am I going to analyze. In conclusion, analysis it is. You ask what on, I am not sure.
