      * Two useful sources                                                
         1.  [Stack exchange: Array length not working](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13541965/array-length-not-working)
         2.  [Stack exchange: Length of a JavaScript object](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5223/length-of-a-javascript-object)
