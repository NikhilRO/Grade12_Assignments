###Reflection Questions
* Compare your initial plan to your actual performance
    * Pretty much what I expected.
    * One thing, I had in mind was perfect transition (like in Prezi). I couldn't implement that. 
  
* Outline your successes:
     * I would consider this one of the most elegant pieces of code I have ever written. 
     * Every detail was given a lot of thought. I tried to make it as efficient as possible and use system memory optimally. This was pertinent given the nature of Big Data. 
     * Furthermore, I really like what I did with recursion in the program. This brought the total lines of code in the program to bare minimum. Admittedly, it did add some complexity but, as I said earlier, I thought through every detail.
* Discuss what difficulties and challenges you incurred.
     * I don't even know where to begin. I thought this project would be just a refresher in what I learned in this course. Oh boy, it was so much more.
     * I would recommend looking at "Learning Moments" section of the [Readme](https://github.com/NikhilRO/Grade12_Assignments/blob/master/Culminating/README.md)
     * It contains detailed account of some of the biggest problems that I encountered. 
     * Some issues can also be found in ["Issues" section](https://github.com/NikhilRO/Grade12_Assignments/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) of repository.
* Make recommendations for how you could improve your work
       * I added this to [plan](https://github.com/NikhilRO/Grade12_Assignments/blob/master/Culminating/PLAN.md). I'll copy-paste it here. 
       * Add functionality to have user input any .csv file and display my visualization.
       * Learn about scopes. [Look here](https://github.com/NikhilRO/Grade12_Assignments/blob/248d54c325459fa6dc71486d87e57a75be49954c/Culminating/Bubble.js#L1) and [here](https://github.com/NikhilRO/Grade12_Assignments/blob/248d54c325459fa6dc71486d87e57a75be49954c/Culminating/README.md)
       * More efficient/impressive packing algorithm for bubbles/circles
       * Add Google image API for images of objects at last level. 
       * Add Undo/Redo option
