# Computer Science Topics

1. #### *Environmental*

   ​	The advent of computers and digital technology brought great rewards to our society in the form of better connectivity, Internet of Things, easily accessible information on every possible topic, advancement in hard sciences due to greater computational capacity. But with these great rewards came adverse consequences on environment; biggest of which are global warming and deforestation. Fortunatly we have realized these drawbacks and are mending our ways to help save the environment. I would say we have made significant progress in our fight against the environmental impacts of electronics. The thing I find most encouraging is the fact that even private players are hopping on the bandwagon to protect environment. For instance, “in terms of electronic waste, RBC works with asset disposal vendors that have environmentally friendly methods of handling electronic waste. "Our main vendor is Global Electric Electronic Processing (GEEP - http://www.geepglobal.com/). They collect our electronic waste and reuse them whenever and however possible, including reselling and donating the equipment. They also recycle IT assets and have plants that demanufacture electronics, and recover resources for other uses,” RBC comments. That is commendable and they have indeed achieved great results. RBC has made a public commitment to send zero electronic waste to landfill by 2018. Till now they have achieved 99% landfill diversion and as they streamline their processes globally, they hope to divert 100% of their e-waste from landfill. This is so encouraging in our fight against e-waste. If every major and minor corporation can achieve this can completely eradicate the problem of e-waste disposal. In addition to that, they also have set various environmental friendly goals as described in their “Environmental Blueprint.” One of them is to increase the energy efficiency of their Canadian enterprise data centers to achieve an annual power use effectiveness value of 1.4 by 2018 (Power use effectiveness or PUE is an energy efficiency measurement for data centers. PUE is a ratio of total energy used by a data center versus the energy dedicated to power the computing equipment.) This helps with my second concern about power consumption. Also, they continue to purchase certified renewable power. Furthermore, the Government of Canada has laid out a clearly stated plan with targets to help converse various facets of the government. I just want to mention one programme that was included in the reply they sent to me: The Computers for Schools Program. In this program the government collects, cleans and refurbishes surplus computers before distributing them to schools, libraries, not-for-profit learning organizations and Aboriginal communities throughout Canada, thereby reducing e-waste.

   To conclude, I feel fairly impressed and confident that future will be better and we will indeed be able to survive for the next 100 years, hopefully. To summarize, there are major issues with electronics: e-waste, power consumption, and threat to ecology. The first two of these concerns are being dealt pretty well with greater emphasis being paid on recycling and other safe disposal methods; also, clean energy resources are being tapped as well as making machines more energy efficient.

2. #### *Ethics*

   ​           Internet is a human creation and only as safe as we try to make it to be. As any human creation it has its own loopholes which crackers or certain hackers can exploit for their selfish gain or folly. Setting ethical standards is a way to draw the line and remove any gray areas of reasoning. In this pursuit, the now defunct International Programmers Guild had developed the Code of Ethics for computer programmers. Some of its elements are never create or distribute malware; never write code that intentionally breaks another programmer's code for the purpose of elevating one's status. 

3. #### *Emerging Technology*

   ​          What is the exocortex? Exocortex is a term coined by researcher Ben Houston to describe the various systems humans may use in thinking but which are not part of our natural brain. It could be as commonplace as a smartphone or as rare as a augmented reality devices. However, the future is beyond these external devices and would involve cognitive enhancement "chips" that would be directly interact with our brain, making them essentially a part of our brain.

4. #### *Collaborative Research*

   ​           Genetics forms a big part in current biological research with advancements in molecular biology and development of technology that allows for faster and more reliable DNA analysis. To see what the field of genetics will look like without computers, we need to consider its current contributions to the field. Nowadays, to conduct research scientists take a sample of DNA and put it in a machine that deciphers the entire sequence of DNA nucleotides. This process is very efficient and takes little human effort. Clearly, this wouldn’t be possible without the use of computing power of the machines. So, this step will take the first hit if we were to be deprived of computers. Now, it is possible to sequence the DNA manually but this process is slow, tedious, and fraught with error. Basically, today's large-scale sequencing projects would be impossible without automatic sequencing machines. Furthermore, we can say that without computers there will be no computer simulations. Also, we won’t be able to analyze patterns in big data we receive from research. To conclude, the development in genetics will be seriously limited for lack of computers.

5. #### *Theoretical Computer Science*

   ​           Graph theory is the mathematical theory of the properties and applications of graphs. Seven Bridges of Königsberg is a historical problem that can be said to have laid the foundation of graph theory.

   Is it possible to walk across each bridge exactly once? Euler proved that the problem has no solution. Proving this assertion with mathematical rigor formed the foundation of Graph theory. Formally speaking a graph is a pair of sets (V, E), where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges, formed by pairs of vertices. 

   Now, graph theory is used for finding communities in networks where we want to detect hierarchies of substructures. In other words, Google uses it to rank hyperlinks. Also, weighted graphs help us in finding the optimal way to a destination( i.e Google maps). Weighted means each edge has a separate "weight".
