# 14-Text-RiTa
This program modifies [13-Text-RegularExpressions](https://github.com/NikhilRO/Grade12_Assignments/tree/master/13-Text-RegularExpressions) to use [Rita](https://rednoise.org/rita) to:
* Calculate how many pronouns, nouns (non-plural), and verbs exist.
* Display this information visually on the screen.

#### Description for Regex Assignment: Create a program to use regular expression to calculate the number of 
1. 2 digit, 3 digit, and 4 digit numbers in the document
2. Words would be formatted as italics
3. ., !, and ? characters

#####Resources:
* [Github Repository for Rita](https://github.com/dhowe/RiTaJS)
* [Reference](http://www.rednoise.org/rita/reference/)
* [Daniel Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPEvh8HbGQ)

####Notes for self
* Try `saveStrings(ritaPosJoined, "words.txt");` [example](https://github.com/NikhilRO/Grade12_Assignments/blob/e736d7d01491a3d863f63c0bd3b99516ec0a083c/15-Text-SortingAlgorithms/sketch.js#L26)
* might need `/R/n` for regex because old typewriters need characters to be returned.
