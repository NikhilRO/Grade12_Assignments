# 10-RecursionAssignment

### Create a program to employ recursion

Following the theme of water, the program uses recursion to create lines (with lengths in Geometric Sequence) in the program to give the impression of the top view of a frozen mountain/structure.


Future Project: Add a ball that moves along the lines. (Idea: Change the attractor to next point once it reaches a point)
