# 15-Text-SortingAlgorithms

### Create a program to use sorting algorithm on a text  
* bubbleSort() for the numbers array
* insertionSort() for the words array

After sorting your arrays, the program displays the information of both arrays in ascending order on the screen.

  * [Insertion Sort (C++/Java)](http://cathyatseneca.github.io/DSAnim/web/insertion.html)

### Note for self
* By default comparison is based on strings because regex gives you strings for everything.
* To compare like numbers use parseInt( ) to convert all Array elements to numbers

* `split()` using regex creates an element at the start and the end that is empty. WHY?
*  So, remove them using `splice()`
