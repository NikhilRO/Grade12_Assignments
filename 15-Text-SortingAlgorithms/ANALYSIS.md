###Time Taken for 
* Numbers
      1. Bubble Sort Time: 3.172 milliseconds
      2. Insertion Sort Time: 0.350 milliseconds
      3. In-built function: 0.344 milliseconds
      
      Efficiency: `.sort()` took around 10 times less time than bubble sort to sort 264 numbers. Insertion sort took almost the same time as `.sort()`.
      
      Reasons: Bubble sort compares each value to every other value to sort it resulting in a lot more comparisons than the more efficient `.sort()` 
      
* Words
      1. Insertion Sort Time: 2840.226 milliseconds
      2. Bubble Sort Time: 7939.974 milliseconds
      3. In-built function: 30.723 milliseconds
      
      Efficiency: `.sort()` took around 92 times less time than insertion sort to sort 15730 words; andover 250 times less time than bubble sort. 
      
      Reasons: Insertion sort is more efficient than bubble sort because it reduces the redundant comparisons in bubble sort by putting the element at its current correct location. But it still has a lot of comparisons; therefore, it is not as efficient as `.sort()` 
      
#####Note that: There was a lot of variation in the values I got in each repetition. WHY? Maybe the processor but the trend was always the same
